## Studio 05 - Interaction in D3.js

This studio is an experiment in loading data from the USGS Live Earthquake feed. We will plot all earthquakes that occurred in the past 24 hours, and filter them with interactive elements. We will be building on our [earlier introduction](https://github.com/emilyfuhrman/datavis_design/blob/master/2019_Spring/Studios/03_Introduction_to_D3.md) to [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). 

### Preparation

We will be working in [Observable](https://beta.observablehq.com/). If you would like to save your work, you must create an Observable account (which requires creating a [Github](https://github.com/) account first).

* Our working template for the day is [here](https://observablehq.com/@emilyfuhrman/d3-js-template-interaction). You may edit this as much as you want.
* For reference only, a master copy is located [here](https://observablehq.com/@emilyfuhrman/observable-test-earthquake-data).
