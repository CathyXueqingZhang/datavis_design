## Studio 03 - Introduction to D3.js

This studio will walk through the process of creating data-driven shapes in the browser using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), a powerful JavaScript library for visualization. 

### Preparation

We will be working in [Observable](https://beta.observablehq.com/). If you would like to save your work, you must create an Observable account (which requires creating a [Github](https://github.com/) account first).

* Our working template for the day is [here](https://beta.observablehq.com/@emilyfuhrman/d3-js-template). You may edit this as much as you want.
* For reference only, a master copy is located [here](https://beta.observablehq.com/@emilyfuhrman/d3-js-master).

All guidelines for this studio may be found in [this](https://github.com/emilyfuhrman/datavis_design/blob/master/2019_Spring/Decks/Week_06.pdf) deck.
